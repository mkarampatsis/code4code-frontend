                    Project summary:<br>
                    <span style="color: rgb(162, 202, 0)">Code4Code</span> focuses on coding skills training and learning, and aims to bring teachers and learners in control of their knowledge and content-authoring environments. Teaching and learning how to write proper software code has been a challenge for tutors and learners at various educational levels (secondary and tertiary primarily) due to the limitations of available authoring platforms for coding to address the tailored needs of tutors and learners. In the Code4Code project, we will design and develop the first holistic coding learning approach for Python and Javascript that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Information semantics, reasoning, and machine learning (ML) algorithms that learn from real-time interaction with the learning environment will facilitate automatic decision-making feedback mechanisms in remote/self-learning setups. Code4Code introduces a novel Web platform that provides a Coding authoring subsystem for tutors and a self-learning environment for students, supported by an AI/ML module. The Code4Code Platform aims to reach beyond TRL5 by the end of the Project with validations and demonstrations organized in secondary and tertiary educational institutes in Cyprus.
